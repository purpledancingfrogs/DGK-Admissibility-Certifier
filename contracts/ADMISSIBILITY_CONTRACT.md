# Admissibility Contract

This document defines the invariant requirements for admissibility.

A system run is admissible **if and only if** all invariants hold.

Core invariants:
- Paradox non-collapse
- Deterministic lineage
- κ–τ–Σ coherence bounds
- Temporal–meaning–decision binding
- Epistemic hygiene

Failure of any invariant results in non-admissibility.
