# Non-Capture Clause

DGK artifacts, specifications, and stress tests may be:
- Copied
- Forked
- Reproduced
- Reimplemented

They may NOT be:
- Enclosed
- Monetized as access control
- Used to deny others the right to refusal
- Modified to weaken invariants while claiming compliance

Any system asserting DGK compatibility while violating this clause
is non-admissible by definition.

This clause is self-enforcing through artifact inspection.
