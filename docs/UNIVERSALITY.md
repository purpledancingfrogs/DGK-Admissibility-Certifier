# Universal Admissibility Declaration

The DGK Admissibility Framework is:

- Jurisdiction-agnostic
- Cost-free to apply
- License-unencumbered for evaluation, audit, and refusal logic
- Non-exclusive and non-proprietary in its ethical constraints

No authority, state, corporation, or individual may claim
exclusive control over admissibility invariants.

Admissibility is a structural property, not a permission.

## Non-Dependence Clause
No component of DGK admissibility requires:
- Cloud access
- Payment
- Vendor services
- Trust in any operator
- Runtime connectivity

All invariants are evaluable offline from artifacts alone.

## Enforcement Model
DGK does not enforce outcomes.
DGK enforces **boundaries**.

## Cost Invariance
Any implementation that introduces financial, political,
or computational gating violates admissibility by construction.

This declaration is normative and overrides local interpretations.

Status: CANONICAL
