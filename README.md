# DGK Admissibility Certifier

A deterministic certification engine that evaluates execution artifacts from
DGK-aligned substrates and emits machine-verifiable admissibility certificates.

This repository defines **jurisdictional admissibility**, not performance,
risk scoring, or probabilistic assessment.

If certification fails, the system output is **non-admissible by construction**.

## Scope
- Deterministic certification only
- Binary outcome: Admissible / Non-Admissible
- External, trust-minimized verification

## Non-Goals
- Model tuning
- Ethics arbitration
- Outcome prediction
- Performance optimization
