# DGK-Admissibility-Certifier

## DGK-Certified — Definition

**DGK-Certified** denotes a decision, execution trace, or system run that satisfies
the full Deterministic Governance Kernel (DGK) admissibility criteria.

A DGK-Certified artifact guarantees:

- Paradox preservation (no forced collapse of contradictions)
- Deterministic traceability and replayability
- κ–τ–Σ coherence stabilization (ethical, temporal, systemic)
- Temporal–meaning–decision binding
- Epistemic hygiene under audit

Any system or decision lacking DGK certification is **non-admissible** for
governance, law, science, or intelligence use.

DGK-Certification is substrate-native, machine-verifiable, and externally auditable.
