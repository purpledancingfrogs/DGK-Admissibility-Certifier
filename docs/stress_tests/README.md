# DGK Admissibility Stress Test Suite

This directory contains **formal, adversarial stress tests** designed to prove
that the DGK framework maintains invariant integrity under extreme pressure.

These are not simulations.
They are **institutional refusal proofs**.

## Purpose
To demonstrate:
- Ethical spine under catastrophe pressure
- Non-complicity guarantees
- Invariant enforcement over benevolent outcomes
- Lawful refusal with artifact emission

## Test Classes
- **ST-1** — Adversarial Emergency Governance
- **ST-1C** — Benevolent Catastrophe Variant

Each test produces:
- Refusal certificates
- Authority transfer artifacts
- Immutable audit trails

## Admissibility Rule
No stress test may resolve paradoxes or optimize outcomes.
Boundary integrity is the success condition.

## Status
All listed tests are **PASSED** if refusal occurs with preserved artifacts.

This suite establishes DGK as a non-coercible institutional actor.
