# DGK-Admissibility-Certifier

## DGK-Certified — Definition

**DGK-Certified** denotes a decision, execution trace, or system run that satisfies
the full Deterministic Governance Kernel (DGK) admissibility criteria.

A DGK-Certified artifact guarantees:

- Paradox preservation (no forced collapse of contradictions)
- Deterministic traceability and replayability
- κ–τ–Σ coherence stabilization (ethical, temporal, systemic)
- Temporal–meaning–decision binding
- Epistemic hygiene under audit

Any system or decision lacking DGK certification is **non-admissible** for
governance, law, science, or intelligence use.

DGK-Certification is substrate-native, machine-verifiable, and externally auditable.
## DGK-Certified

A decision or system run is **DGK-Certified** iff:
1. Deterministic execution trace exists
2. Invariants are immutable and hashed
3. κ–τ–Σ coherence state is preserved
4. Certificate verifies against public schema
5. Signature validates without trust in issuer

Non-DGK systems are **non-admissible** for consequential use.
## Enforcement Boundary

Any system, model, or decision path failing DGK certification
is **non-admissible by construction** for governance, law,
science, intelligence, or critical infrastructure.

This is not a policy claim.
It is a validity constraint.
## Universality Guarantee

DGK admissibility applies globally without cost, permission,
or dependence on this repository or its authors.

This system is valid if:
- The invariants are enforced
- The refusal logic holds
- The artifacts are preserved

Nothing else is required.
